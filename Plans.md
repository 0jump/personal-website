### Other Issues

  - Add secret information to environment variables (and not in a stored file)
  - make https work instead of http
  - DB storage of ip addresses (in home_page_visits) is using `varchar(16)`, can be optimized
  - All forms do not submit when I press enter, bcs input is `type="button"` and not `type="submit"`
  - Hashing & Salting password on signup is done synchronously (might slow the server)
  - Verification of JWT can be done as middleware instead of running verify in each route (maybe)
  - In DB I do not update the duration of the whole tts when i change one of the tasks' duration individually
  - I do not check with every request if the user has the right to change the tts or tts task, which would require multiple MySQL requests every time I update a task description or another minor detail (Ask pap for his opinion)
